ews-javascript-api 
==================
## Exchange Web Service in JavaScript/TypeScript.

===========================================================================================    

## September 2017 Update:  
You can now use this in Ionic, Cordova, Browser based process (where CORS is disabled), Outlook Add-in or Mail apps. see [`ews-js-api-browser`](https://github.com/gautamsi/ews-js-api-browser) for more detail    
# Current State:
* Almost all methods in ExchangeService class is comple with respect to c# counterpart ([based on commit#31951f4 ](https://github.com/OfficeDev/ews-managed-api/commit/31951f456519786e41232fa9ff6a3ab20b56cac3)
    * some method skipped as they are not for client side code or are diaognostic methods. 
* Roadmap to Beta:
    * ~ReWrite XHR/Request and Promise see #94~ done
    * Rewrite Autodiscover code with fresh Promise approach, this code was my work in very beginning and poorly written, strategy and TypeScript features improved over time which this code isnt taking any advantage of.
    * Add jsdoc comment to remaining exported class
* Roadmap to 1.0
    * fix bugs from Beta
    * complete code improvement based on diff from original snapshot
    * basic tests to be introduced to prevent breaking changes
    * Add documentation with sample code for each operation in ExchangeService methods
    * Integrate ntlm and cookies authentication code in main library 
* Beyond 1.0 
    * ~Add npm based typings support for lates TypeScript based workflow~ completed in `0.9.0`
    * minified version for any developer need 
    * String Null check to improve reliability, TypeScript 2.0 feature
    * Complete jsdoc comment in 
    * Complete code for new features introduced after the snapshot I was working on
    * Add OAuth authentication with Azure AD (needs admin created APP in Azure AD)
    * Break into components to have better performance and download
    * enable non Node scenarios
    * trimmed version for Outlook Mail APP supported EWS calls  

===========================================================================================

EWS managed API for TypeScript/JavaScript - code ported from OfficeDev/ews-managed-api. availbale for nodejs, browser and mobile devices (cordova).  

Pluggable XHRApi adapter to replace client (browser) based XHR call with server brokered call (example coming soon). Example Ruby on rails, PHP or any server side framework where c# or nodejs is not available

Works with **Office 365/Exchange Online** and on-premises Exchange (2007 - 2016)

## Authentication
* Basic - inbuilt
* OAuth - inbuilt (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/43785262/5884960 for more details on how to use.)
* NTLM and NTLMv2 - using [ews-javascript-api-auth](https://github.com/gautamsi/ews-javascript-api-auth) 
* Cookies/FBA Authentication with TMG/ISA - using [ews-javascript-api-auth](https://github.com/gautamsi/ews-javascript-api-auth) 

> use SSL for basic authentication  
NTLM and Cookies Authentication works with nodejs only

## Modules
* commonjs module for NodeJs
* AMD module for other scenarios* (not documented yet)

All http call is wrapped in promise using default BlueBird promise.  You can also interchange compatible promise api.  
Code sample from [EWS Managed API 2.1.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj536567.aspx) should work with little modificaion to Promise format   
You can also leverage new async/await feature of nodejs (>7.0.6) or in TypeScript transpilation with es5/es6 code.  


## Documentation
Api document generated using TypeDoc and is hosted at [ews-javascript-api.github.io/api](http://ews-javascript-api.github.io/api).  ** outdated
Check [Wiki](https://github.com/gautamsi/ews-javascript-api/wiki) for more details

keep track of what is coming in [backlog](https://github.com/gautamsi/ews-javascript-api/milestones/backlog), keep eye on [milestones](https://github.com/gautamsi/ews-javascript-api/milestones) when I start working on it 

# Whats new v0.9.3

* new: you can now use ContactGroup for private DL functionality, `GroupMember` and `GroupMemberCollection` classes are implemented 
* new: added code for passing options to underlying Fetch library. most requested option was allowing use of untrusted certificate.  
* fix: #241 `ExtendedPropertyCollection` code updated, was not letting changes in Email or Phone number in contact object. 
* fix: #242 `SimpleServiceRequestBase` code improved, should prevent unhandled rejection in case of response status 200 and local parsing errors. 
* fix: #250 fixed writing logic for `ExtendedPropertyDefinition` propertyset in output xml. 
* fix: #256 `ServiceResponseCollection.GetEnumerator()` is now returning `Responses` array rather than throwing error. 
* fix: #261 added skipLibCheck option in tsconfig, otherwise building from source would be throwing some error for type checking in dependency libs. 
* fix: #274 fixed array initialization in `DeleteAttachmentRequest`, it was preventing any request to DeleteAttachment in EWS. 
* fix: #277 fixed an issue where setting `Contact.FileAsMapping` would not work and cause unhandled Excepttion 

## snippet for 0.9.3

### how to provide fetch options:
```ts
import {....., ConfigurationApi, .......} from 'ews-javascript-api';
// use this before instantiating ExchangeService 
ConfigurationApi.SetXHROptions({rejectUnauthorized : false});
```

# Getting Started
## install
```shell
[sudo] npm install ews-javascript-api
``` 

## use
```javascript
//classic Javascript style
var ews = require('ews-javascript-api');
var exch = new ews.ExchangeService(ews.ExchangeVersion.Exchange2013);
//ES6 TypeScript style
import {ExchangeService, AutodiscoverService, Folder, Item, ExchangeVersion} from "ews-javascript-api";
var exch = new ExchangeService(ExchangeVersion.Exchange2013);
```
## Autodiscover user settings
```javascript
//import ews module
var ews = require('ews-javascript-api');
//create AutodiscoverService object
var autod = new ews.AutodiscoverService(new ews.Uri("https://autodiscover-s.outlook.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.svc"), ews.ExchangeVersion.Exchange2010);
//you can omit url and it will autodiscover the url, version helps throw error on client side for unsupported operations.example - //var autod = new ews.AutodiscoverService(ews.ExchangeVersion.Exchange2010);
//set credential for service
autod.Credentials = new ews.ExchangeCredentials("userName", "password");
//create array to include list of desired settings
var settings = [
ews.UserSettingName.InternalEwsUrl,
ews.UserSettingName.ExternalEwsUrl,
ews.UserSettingName.UserDisplayName,
ews.UserSettingName.UserDN,
ews.UserSettingName.EwsPartnerUrl,
ews.UserSettingName.DocumentSharingLocations,
ews.UserSettingName.MailboxDN,
ews.UserSettingName.ActiveDirectoryServer,
ews.UserSettingName.CasVersion,
ews.UserSettingName.ExternalWebClientUrls,
ews.UserSettingName.ExternalImap4Connections,
ews.UserSettingName.AlternateMailboxes
];
//get the setting
autod.GetUserSettings(["email1@domain.com", "email2@domain.com"], settings)
.then(function (response) {
    //do what you want with user settings    
    var tabcount = 0;
    var tabs = function () { return ews.StringHelper.Repeat("\t", tabcount); };
    console.log(autod.Url.ToString());
	//uncoment next line to see full response from autodiscover, you will need to add var util = require('util');
	//console.log(util.inspect(response, { showHidden: false, depth: null, colors: true }));
    for (var _i = 0, _a = response.Responses; _i < _a.length; _i++) {
        var resp = _a[_i];
        console.log(ews.StringHelper.Format("{0}settings for email: {1}", tabs(), resp.SmtpAddress));
        tabcount++;
        for (var setting in resp.Settings) {
            console.log(ews.StringHelper.Format("{0}{1} = {2}", tabs(), ews.UserSettingName[setting], resp.Settings[setting]));
        }
        tabcount--;
    }
}, function (e) {
    //log errors or do something with errors
});
```

## Example EWS operations
Example of user availability
```javascript
var ews = require('ews-javascript-api');
//create ExchangeService object
var exch = new ews.ExchangeService(ews.ExchangeVersion.Exchange2013);
exch.Credentials = new ews.ExchangeCredentials("userName", "password");
//set ews endpoint url to use
exch.Url = new ews.Uri("https://outlook.office365.com/Ews/Exchange.asmx"); // you can also use exch.AutodiscoverUrl

var attendee =[ new ews.AttendeeInfo("email1@domain.com"), new ews.AttendeeInfo("email2@domain.com")];
//create timewindow object o request avaiability suggestions for next 48 hours, DateTime and TimeSpan object is created to mimic portion of .net datetime/timespan object using momentjs
var timeWindow = new ews.TimeWindow(ews.DateTime.Now, ews.DateTime.Now.AddDays(2)); 
exch.GetUserAvailability(attendee, timeWindow, ews.AvailabilityData.FreeBusyAndSuggestions)
.then(function (availabilityResponse) {
    //do what you want with user availability
}, function (errors) {
    //log errors or do something with errors
});
        
```
